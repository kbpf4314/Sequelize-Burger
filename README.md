# BURGER 

In this application you can enter any kind of burger into the text field, add it to the MySQL database. Under the "devour it" column clicking the available burgers will push the burger into the "devoured" column. This updates the database everytime you eat a burger.

Now updated with Sequelize!

Languages used: MySQL, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Handlebars.
